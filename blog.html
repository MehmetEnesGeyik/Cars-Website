        <h2>7 benefits of a car: What you should know
        </h2><hr><br>
        <p style="font-size: 13px;" >Are you planning on getting a car?

            If you live in the United States, owning a car is a necessity. In the U.S. alone, there are over 93% of households who report owning at least one vehicle. As our cities grow and continue to evolve, the rate of car ownership will only keep rising.
            
            Owning a car is a lifetime investment. If you don’t already own a car, you may be thinking about it.
            
            Are you wondering if you should own a car? In this article, we give you seven benefits of a car. Read on to discover why getting a car is a smart and beneficial choice.
            
                <br><br><strong>1. Health and Emergencies</strong><br>         
            The safest way to ensure your health in the pandemic is by owning a private car. The recent health crisis pushes many to follow new health policies. The best way to observe social distancing is by getting a car.
            
            Taking public transportation can put you more at risk of infection. You may meet potential carriers when you take buses and other forms of public transport. If you own a car, you can take control of who gets in and out of your car.
            
            You can avoid exposure and lower any medical expenses. One of the other benefits of a car is easy to access during emergencies.
            
            A single ambulance ride can cost you about $300 on average plus mileage. Owning a car will help you cut costs and get you where you need to be in case of an emergency.
            
                <br><br><strong>2. Indepence and Freedom</strong><br>
            
            Relying on others for travel or using public vehicles could be detrimental. When you take public transport, you may worry about reaching your stop on time. If you miss your bus, you may throw your schedule off your schedule by fifteen to thirty minutes.
            
            Owning a car means that you don’t have to adjust your schedule to others. You don’t have to rely on others to get you to your destination. One of the benefits of owning a car is self-reliance and independence.
            
            All you need to worry about is paying for your gas money. You don’t have to rely on public buses, friends, or family.
